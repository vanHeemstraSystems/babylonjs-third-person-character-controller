We are following this initial creation of our BabylonJS app; [Babylon.js ES6 support with Tree Shaking](https://doc.babylonjs.com/setup/frameworkPackages/es6Support) and hosted at https://github.com/RaananW/babylonjs-webpack-es6

## Usage

After installation (```npm install```) and starting (```npm start```) the babylonjs service (at containers/app/babylonjs/), a browser window will show the BabylonJS environment and imported meshes (e.g. character). The character can be controlled by keypress as follows:

Keyboard press:

- 'w' for walking straight forward
- 'a' for turning left whilst walking
- 'd' for turning right whilst walking
- 's' for walking backwards
- 'b' for dancing

*NOTE*: When holding Shift, the walking will be faster (except for the walking backwards).

Gamepad (type Xbox360Pad):

If your Gamepad is not recognized, try (re-)plugging it into your computer again.

- 'left stick forward' for walking straight forward
- 'left stick left' for turning left whilst walking
- 'left stick right' for turning right whilst walking
- 'left stick backward' for walking backwards
- 'button B' for dancing
